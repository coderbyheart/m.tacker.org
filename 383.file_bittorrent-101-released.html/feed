		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Bug #5836 (Support for files &#062; 2GB) is a pain in the ass to test, so no progress there. I appreciate every help here.&quot; 
Some time ago, I posted a patch to that bug on pear.php.net. Since then I am using the patch on various projects, and I have not yet seen any problems. I&#039;d like to help with the testing, because the bug realy blocks my projects, and I would like to see it fixed as soon as possible.

If there is any way I can assist, please write my email!

Good luck!
