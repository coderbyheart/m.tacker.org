# This is the configuration file for inlineRSS.php, the WordPress Plugin
#
# This file contains one line per different feed entry, containing the
# following comma-separated parameters:
#
# casualname:  What you will call your feed, such as "myfeed"
# url: The complete path, including http:// to the feed
# cache time: The minimum number of minutes between fetching the
#    feed.  This is optional and defaults to 30
# xslt file: The alternate xslt file to use, instead of inlineRSS.xslt.
#    This is optional and defaults to inlineRSS.xslt.  Additionally,
#    you can use the following keywords in place of an xslt file:
#
#    skipxslt - This will pull the file in without attempting to
#               translate it, so any source can be inserted.
#    eval - This will evaluate the file as a PHP script, and use
#           whatever is returned using "return" as what is to be
#           inserted.  It does not support <?php ?> - those are
#           HTML exclusion tags used by the web server.
#
# A sample feed to read from www.iconophobia.com is below.  It can be
# called from a WordPress post or page using !inlineRSS:iconophobia
# or from a template (.php) as inlineRSS('iconophobia');
