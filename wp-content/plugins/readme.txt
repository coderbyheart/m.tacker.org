== DESCRIPTION ==

This plugin creates various quicktags / WYSIWYG buttons for inserting both self-hosted videos (AVI,
WMV, MOV, MPEG, and FLV) and website hosted videos (YouTube, Google Video, and IFILM) into your blog.


== INSTALLATION ==

Upload the ENTIRE folder to your plugins folder (`/wp-content/plugins/`) while keeping the file
structure intact. You've done it right if you end up with a folder called "vipers_videoquicktags"
and some folders and files inside it.

Then just activate it on your plugin management page.


== USAGE ==

On your write post/page screen, just click one of the buttons and fill in the ID or URL for the
video. The prompt will give you instructions and an example.


== UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION ==

Just delete ALL file(s) from the previous version and then see the installation instructions above.

== ADVANCED USAGE ==

If you'd like to control the width and height of the YouTube/Google Video/IFILM videos, then just
add width and height tags to the BBCode like this:

[youtube width="850" height="652"]hl2UUunlI2Q[/youtube]

If you'd like to embed FLV files in your blog, then the tag is "[flv]" and the width and height
parameters are REQUIRED.
